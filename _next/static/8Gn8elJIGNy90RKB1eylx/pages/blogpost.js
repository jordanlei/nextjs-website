Then again, I suppose it was nice of them to ask, in a well-it\u2019s-happening-anyway-I-hope-you\u2019re-not-mad way. If I recall correctly, I was pretty neutral on the matter, but I had a few concerns about the various horror stories I had heard about growing up with a little sibling. What if he takes my toys? What if he tattles on me? What if, what if, what if. Here\u2019s the thing: in childhood, there are a lot of choices you get to make, but for a long and significant portion of it most of it only revolves around the people you hang out with. Of course, parents always had an indirect say in what you do, what activities you\u2019re involved in, and final jurisdiction on whether or not sleepovers were allowed that night (if Mom says no, go ask Dad), but all in all, most of my free reign was over the people I could hang out with.

Tiny human is really too much credit; he looked more like a russet potato. He was born on Valentine\u2019s Day, which my parents thought was romantic and endearing and me, well, not so much. I had the big-brother foresight of being vastly concerned about my brother being pushed around for having his birthday on a day that represented icky things like love. Oh well, at least it was easy to remember. They chose Matthew for his name, going with the whole biblical-naming scheme."),y("p",null,"When I was in third grade, my teacher, Mrs. Schukart asked us to write some poems. I wrote one about Matthew. Although I\u2019m a little fuzzy on the details, I remember saying something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t need Matthew to be rich, or famous, or the president. All I want is for him to be happy.\u201d I never thought much of it, but apparently the parents who saw it in curriculum night were very impressed. I didn\u2019t think it meant that much at the time. Being a big brother meant a lot of things, as my parents constantly reminded me. I had to be an example, a leader, a teacher, a guardian, all at once. It wasn\u2019t always an easy thing to do. All of a sudden, our house was flooded with things catered towards toddler-related life. The attention I got from my parents slowly diminished, and it felt at times like I was traversing this weird and scary thing called childhood somewhat on my own. All while being the role model for a squishy, not yet fully-functioning toddler. Although I wouldn\u2019t admit it out loud, and I can\u2019t pinpoint an exact example, I think every big brother has felt moments of jealousy, frustration, and even anger towards the younger. Because being a big brother is just such a large role, such an important position, that there is no way I, even now- let alone then, could comprehend its immensity."),y("p",null,"I remember the times when my friends would come over to my place to hang out and play Wii, which at the time, was the pinnacle of entertainment. My parents would sometimes throw in my little brother to hang out with us, and I remember being distinctly upset that we had to include him in our activities. Being six and a half years younger than I was, he had no way to compete with seasoned, well-trained Wii connoisseurs, so we usually just threw him a Wii controller that had no batteries in it so he could pretend he was playing. But being a big brother didn\u2019t always involve me slighting my poor baby brother.

I had to carve out my own path, walk through the thorns and bristles, and traverse the unknown. Every path was the path least traveled, because there were no paths there in the first place. We moved constantly while I was little. When I was two, we moved from China to Canada, and later when I was six, over to Portland. I had been to so many schools, said my first hellos and last goodbyes to so many people, that by the time I was in third grade all I wanted to do was fit in. Matthew will never know that.

But Jordan, you might say, he\u2019s six-and-a-half-years younger than you. Shouldn\u2019t he have much more to complain about? That might be true, but I don\u2019t know. I think we all have our struggles. Matthew\u2019s hugely talented, especially in art. One year, both he and I won best-in-state awards for various art competitions. Mine was the Federal Junior Duck Stamp Competition, and his was the Doodle4Google competition. I was happy for him, for sure, but my prize was a small certificate and a framed version of my original work. Matthew came home with this massive larger-than-life blown up version of his painting. And by massive, I mean it literally would not fit in the dorm I live in today. My parents hung it up in the foyer, so big and so blatantly obvious you couldn\u2019t miss it if you tried.
